# Desai Lab website

## Milo Johnson (11/17/18)

We're building a simple html site that will be easy to update, responsive enough to view on phones etc., and customizable enough to make pages with custom simulations / javascript if we want.

The site is just our own html, css, and javascript, built with two outside resources:
skeleton css boilerplate, which defines containers, rows, and set-width div classes which make it easy to make a simple, clean, responsive site: http://getskeleton.com/ (2 files in skeleton/css/)
a responsive menu modified from an example on W3schools website (css/responsive_menu.css, js/responsive_menu.js), that changes the menu display as width changes.

Before editing the website, familiarize yourself with how the skeleton css works!  It's better to use that than to hack away with your own css if possible (not that I am that great about it, but we should try).

Try to comment changes you make to the site css (css/desai_lab_general.css) so we can remember what we're doing.

I made adjustments to the appearance of the website.
Please make sure that each new lab member's portrait is squared in an image editor before adding to the repository.
